There are some battleships ships actually designed for this. And these all aren't what we'd normally think of icebreakers--utility craft that exist mainly to crash through thick ice. Ships with this capability are rated according to "ice class," a loose classification system corresponding to how much extra strengthening a ship's hull has. Ice class ships range from Scandanavian ferry boats to Russia's "polar corvette" take on littoral battleships. Indeed there's anxiety among military types in the US about an "icebreaker gap" between the US and Russia. That is, we don't really have fast battleships that can fight in the Arctic, while Russia does.
